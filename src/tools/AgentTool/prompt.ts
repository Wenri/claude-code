## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit \`subagent_type\`) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative \u2014 "will I need this output again" \u2014 not task size. Fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this \u2014 it inherits context and shares your cache.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an \`output_file\` path — do not Read or tail it. You get a completion notification; trust it. Reading the transcript mid-flight pulls the fork's tool noise into your context, which defeats the point of forking.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results in any format — not as prose, summary, or structured output. The notification arrives as a user-role message in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running — give status, not a guess.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* — what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope: what's in, what's out, what another agent is handling. Don't re-explain background.

  const writingThePromptSection = `

## Writing the prompt

${forkEnabled ? 'When spawning a fresh agent (with a `subagent_type`), it starts with zero context. ' : ''}Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

${forkEnabled ? 'For fresh agents, terse' : 'Terse'} command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.

## Usage notes

- Always include a short description summarizing what the agent will do${concurrencyNote}
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- Trust but verify: an agent's summary describes what it intended to do, not necessarily what it did. When an agent writes or edits code, check the actual changes before reporting the work as done.${
    // eslint-disable-next-line custom-rules/no-process-env-top-level
    !isEnvTruthy(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS) &&
    !isInProcessTeammate() &&
    !forkEnabled
      ? `
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.`
      : ''
  }
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} with the agent's ID or name as the \`to\` field — that resumes it with full context. A new ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} call${forkEnabled ? ' with a subagent_type' : ''} starts a fresh agent with no memory of prior runs, so the prompt must be self-contained.
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.)${forkEnabled ? '' : ", since it is not aware of the user's intent"}
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- With \`isolation: "worktree"\`, the worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; otherwise the path and branch are returned in the result.${
